This repo contains my implementation of the Turing School API Curious project.

You can find the original assignment here: https://github.com/turingschool/lesson_plans/blob/master/ruby_03-professional_rails_applications/apicurious.md

I used Twitter Oauth and the Twitter API to build a basic version of Twitter. You can login, view your feed, post a tweet and favorite a tweet. 

You can find the production version of my app here: http://rooney-carrier-pigeon.herokuapp.com/
